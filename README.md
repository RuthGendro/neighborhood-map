###Neighborhood Fishing Data Project

Here is a [link](https://ruthgendro.github.io/neighborhood-map/) to the live project.

This app is to track data for all the fishing done locally by my boyfriend and I. I will add lakes we we continue, and use this app to keep track of dates and how many fish are caught. I do not the have data for fishing trips yet, but it should meet requirements for Udacity's project. You are able to seach for differents lake on the map, in the list, or via searching. The Google map is loaded asynchronously and Foursquare data is brought in via AJAX for each lake. When you click on a lake on the map, the data for that place is displayed. Additonally, the map and markers are styled to stand out, and the marker also changes colors when highlighted, and bounces when clicked.

Built using jQuery and KnockoutJS.
